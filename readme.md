### Objectives

This assignment taught me how to add buttons whose visibility depended on the cursor. This was particularly useful for not crowding the screen until it reached a smaller size (960px for a mobile view), at which point all buttons were visible. This was done using a media query.

I also applied listeners to each of the buttons. I believe this will come in handy later on, when the buttons have functionality.
